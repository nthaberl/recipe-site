# About nomDB üç∞

nomDB is a resource for finding and saving recipes. Ever make a recipe and wanted to add notes, or realize the proportions aren't quite right? You can edit the recipes as needed to add your own personal touch!

This project uses Firebase to handle user login, registration, and authentication. SpoonacularAPI is used to retrieve recipes and when a user would like to save a recipe to their collection, a copy is saved. Recipes are saved to the user's profile utilizing Firebase. From there, a user is able to modify a recipe by adding, editing, and deleting ingredients and instructions and even adding their own notes if they wish.
